            The Sun and the Moon are the brightest and most significant celestial objects in astrology and are referred to as the luminaries. Luminary stands for "Source of light". These placements, along with the 1st house, are considered the main three that encompass a person's core personality. 
        </p>
        <h3>Sun Placement</h3>

        <h2>Planet Placements</h2>
        <p>
            Planet placements can tell us where we store our energy. It can also tell us what our weaknesses and strengths are. The closer planets are to Earth, the more they have an impact on personality, these are called Personal Planets. As we move further away, the planets move slower in return these represent generational trends, these are called generational planets. The middle ground between these two groups is called social or transpersonal planets. They represent the transition from personal to impersonal planets. In total, there are 8 planets. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Planets: Mercury, Venus, and Mars</li>

        <h2>House Placements</h2>
        <p>
            There are 12 houses, in total, that represent different aspects of your life. They can represent you, your family, or your career. Similarly to planetary rulers, house placements have a house ruler, where each house has a planet that rules it. Like planets, houses follow a path. Starting from the 1st house, it’s about the individual. As you go further down to the 12th house, it transitions towards the collective society. The most important placements would be the 1st House and 10th House.
        </p>
        <h3>1st House</h3>
        <p>
            The first house can also be called your Ascendant Sign. If the Sun Sign is considered your exterior self, the 1st House is considered your inner self. It also represents how others view you and how you view the world.
        </p>
        <h3>10th House</h3>
        <p>
            The 10th house has a couple names it goes by, Midheaven and Medium Coeli. In Latin, Medium Coeli stands for “middle of the sky”, it has this name because the 10th house is the highest point in a natal chart. This house represents social status, and career, and determines how ambitious someone is. In general, it is heavily associated with someone’s workplace.
